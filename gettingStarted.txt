Few steps need to be performed in order to use start using test stored procedures:

 1. Create new DB 'Astro' - the easiest way is to open 'New Query' window in your Databases in Management
    Studio and run DB.sql query. This will create new database 'Astro' with entire structure
 2. Import TestData to DB 'Astro' - In the 'Object Explorer' window, right click on your database and select
    Tasks -> Import Data. Then just select in Data Source a 'Flat File Source' and then provided TestData.csv
	file. Check out 'Column names in the first data row' checkbox and the last thing you have to remember is
	to change from schema from [dbo].[TestData] to [data].[TestData] -> This will create/repopulate 
	existing [data].[TestData].
 3. And finally populate metadata table running metadata.sql in your DB.

Below is an example how to process data and run tests procedures

   exec data.insertTestData @observationId=1, @starName='Denebola', @startDate='20160303', @endDate='20160303'
   exec bi.observationsDelta @observationId=1

   exec test.observationsCounts @observationId=1, @stagingTable='stg.stagingObservations', @deltaTable='bi.observations'
   exec test.observationsComparison @observationId=1, @stagingTable='stg.stagingObservations', @deltaTable='bi.observations', @reportMode='Y

Procedures executions are logged in

  select * from log.log

And test result is inserted to

   select * from util.testStatus
 
 
Have a nice testing
